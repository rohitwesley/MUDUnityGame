# Game : My names is MUD
My Name Is MUD sets the Player in a magnificent Castle where he/she loves to collect loot but he needs to take care of his Countess Fe who sleepwalks in the night. Don't get caught by the patrolling Ghosts who roam the corridors. Stealthily explore the Castle for loot while avoiding the Ghosts and keeping the Countess from waking up ! Use the Sneaky Sleeper to make a ghost slowly go to sleep, the Zapper Stunner to make a sleeping ghost temporarily sleepwalk for a bit, throw Sticky Slime to stick ghosts to the wall.

## Game Objectives 
The objective of the game is to explore the Castle for loot while making sure Countess Fe gets to sleepwalk safely for as many nights as possible, scoring points by finding loot while not getting caught by the Patrolling Ghost.
